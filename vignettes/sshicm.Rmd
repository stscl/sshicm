## 1. Introduction to `sshicm` package

### 1.1 The `sshicm` package can be used to address following issues:

- Information consistency-based measures of spatial stratified heterogeneity intensity for continuous and nominal variables.

- Strength of spatial pattern associations based on information consistency measures.

### 1.2 Example data in the `sshicm` package

#### baltim data

"baltim" consists of [Baltimore home sale prices and hedonics][5]. In total, there are 221 instances in "baltim" data. The explanatory variables are whether it is a detached unit (DWELL), whether it has a patio (PATIO), whether it has a fireplace (FIREPL), whether it has air conditioning (AC), and whether the dwelling is in Baltimore County (CITCOU, while the target variable is the sale price of the home (PRICE).


#### cinc data

"cinc" is derived from [the 2008 Cincinnati Crime + Socio-Demographics dataset][6]. It includes spatial data on 457 objects located on an irregular lattice. The explanatory variables are male population (MALE), female population (FEMALE), median age (MEDIAN_AGE), average family size (AVG_FAMSIZ), and population density (DENSITY), while the target variable is the existence of theft (THEFT_D).
